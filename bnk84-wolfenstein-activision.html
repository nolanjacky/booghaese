                            <p> Having grown up with the 80s original, Last year I've gotten an Xbox and New Order (thanks to Gamepass) was my reintroduction to the current gen Wolfenstein series. Played NO, OB and NC back to back. And now I want more Wolfenstein. (Really looking forward to the Young Blood). I'm not really an intensive gamer and not into online gaming. The Wolfenstein games really gave me that nostalgic fps feeling, Medal of Honor Airborne was the last which gave me this same feeling. I've tried BF1/V 
Is the game worth buying? Will it ever come to Steam. I recently got a physical copy of the game and the manual says to put the keycode on Activision's website and the key is a few characters shorter than Steam. It has grabbed my attention that there will be no swastikas appearing in the upcoming call of duty game, even though it is set during World War 2 and has you fighting against Germany. It's my view that what is an obvious attempt to avoid any controversy, is actually more 'offensive' than the idea of having a swastika in the game. It straight up devalues the sacrifices of the millions of veterans who died fighting the Nazis and avoids telling history as it was. Furthermore, there will inevitabl. What circumstances happened that the PC port of Wolf 09 is so rare and costly. 
With all the hype around Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus and Wolfenstein: The New Order being game of the month November 2017 I thought I should give Wolfenstein another try. I played the original Wolfenstein from a Datasette at a friends house, played halfway through Return to Castle Wolfenstein (wasn't too fond of the supernatural stuff) and absolutely loved Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. As far as I can tell there are currently the following modern Wolfenstein games:. Many shooters are returning to their roots with outstanding success. With the releases of Wolfenstein: TNO, Shadow Warrior (and its upcoming sequel), and now Doom, it's high time another corner of the shooter universe was revived: the many entries by RavenSoft. Let's take a look at the games they left behind: Soldier of Fortune Last entry: Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix (What's "Payback"? Never heard of it.) Highest rated entry: Soldier of Fortune https://www.youtube.com/. I, and I'm sure many others here, missed out on the game in the first round of backwards compatible titles because we bought it before Bethesda purchased id and took over publishing rights. I noticed today that it showed up in my ready to download section. I installed it and it actually loads up the Bethesda published version. Not sure how new this is or how many people it will affect Heretic or Hexen - The world needs a new occult gore FPS with today's photo realism graphics! The franchises have laid dormant for years but the time is right to revive them into a super occult party of sorcery and giblet nastiness. I know that you old school FPS fans can agree with me. The potential for a new sorcery occult gore laden based FPS is huge now with the particles they could use and didn't have available in the 90s. It'd be an orgy of awesome. Imagine a duel with the Heresiarch. Note: This is a work in progress. More deals and/or links will be posted to this list as they become available.
